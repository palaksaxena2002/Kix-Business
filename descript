 I‚Äôm excited to share Part 1 of my Kix Business Analysis project, created in Excel! This project focuses on understanding key metrics for a business, with a comprehensive dashboard that provides valuable insights.

 

üîç **What I‚Äôve Built So Far:**

The foundation of this project is a well-structured **data model** that connects key business entities such as customers, products, sales transactions, and sales personnel. Here's an overview of how the data is organized:

 

tables overview

 monthly_store_targets: data on monthly targets set for various stores.

Dim_Products: dimension table for products, containing more details like product name, category, price, etc.

sales_persons_table: details about salespersons, such as names, store affiliations, etc.

Dim_Customer: A dimension table containing customer details, such as gender, age, and location.

fact: This is the fact table, representing transactional data, where the sales data is stored (Product ID, Customer ID, Sales Person ID, Quantity Sold, Payment Method, etc.).

Date: date dimension table with fields such as year, month, and day for more granular time-based analysis.

Calculations: contains predefined measures and calculated columns, such as profit margins, revenue, or other KPIs.

 

Data model overview

## data model allows for a detailed analysis of sales performance by product, customer demographics, sales personnel, and time. By linking fact (transactional) data to various dimensions, it provides rich insights into revenue, profit margins, store performance, and salesperson contributions.  - Key relationships include:

   - `

Dim_Customer ‚Üî fact

Relationship: One-to-many.

Description: Each customer (from Dim_Customer) can have multiple transactions (in the fact table), but each transaction is linked to a single customer.

2. Dim_Products ‚Üî fact

Relationship: One-to-many.

Description: Each product (from Dim_Products) can appear in many transactions (in the fact table), but each transaction is tied to a specific product.

3. sales_persons_table ‚Üî fact

Relationship: One-to-many.

Description: Each salesperson can be associated with multiple sales transactions (in the fact table), but each sale is handled by one salesperson.

4. Date ‚Üî fact

Relationship: One-to-many.

Description: The Date table helps track each sales transaction‚Äôs date-related attributes like year, month, and day, and multiple transactions can occur on the same date.

5. monthly_store_targets ‚Üî sales_persons_table

Relationship: One-to-many.

Description: Each store in the monthly_store_targets table has monthly targets and can have many salespersons linked to it, but each salesperson is assigned to one store.

6. Calculations ‚Üî fact

Relationship: One-to-one or one-to-many (depending on use).

Description: The Calculations table is used to store derived metrics like profit margin, total revenue, and cost of goods sold (COGS) based on the transactional data in the fact table. These calculations are applied to the transactions.

 

This structure follows a star schema where the fact table (central transactional data) is surrounded by dimension tables that provide more detailed information about customers, products, salespersons, dates, and stores.

 

üìà **Dashboard Metrics**:

The dashboard currently tracks essential **KPIs** such as:

 

 **Total Revenue**: total sales revenue generated by the business during a given time frame (e.g., yearly or monthly, filtered by the slicer).

  

COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**the total direct costs incurred in producing the goods sold by the business, such as manufacturing or procurement costs.

 

Profit Margin**: amount of profit made after subtracting the cost of goods sold from the total revenue, indicating the gross profit before operating expenses.

 

% Profit Margin**:shows how much of the revenue is retained as profit after covering COGS. It is calculated as (Profit Margin / Total Revenue) * 100.

 

Transactions**:the total number of sales transactions conducted during the time period, providing insight into the volume of sales activity.

 

Total Refund**:The total amount refunded to customers for returned products or services, indicating customer returns or cancellations.

 

Refund Rate**:The percentage of revenue that has been refunded, showing the proportion of sales that were returned relative to the total sales revenue.

 

Products:The number of distinct products sold during the period. This provides insight into the diversity of the product catalog.

 

Qty Returned:The total quantity of items that were returned by customers during the given period, which can indicate product dissatisfaction or issues.

 

Total Qty:The total quantity of all products sold during the selected period. This number reflects the overall sales volume in terms of units sold.

 

Total Target: the total sales target set for the business, allowing for a comparison between actual performance (`Total Revenue`) and the planned or forecasted goals.



üìÖ With slicers that allow filtering by **month** and the ability to compare actual sales against **targets**, the dashboard helps highlight performance gaps and areas for improvement. The data model also supports time-based analysis, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

 

This project demonstrates how Excel can be a powerful tool for creating actionable business insights, and I‚Äôm eager to continue refining the analysis in future phases!

 

üë®‚Äçüíª Stay tuned for Part 2, where I‚Äôll dive deeper into profitability and performance comparisons.
